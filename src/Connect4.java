 *          Plagiarism is a serious offense and can be easily detected. Please
 *          don't share your code to your classmate even if they are threatening
 *          you with your friendship. If they don't have the ability to work on
 *          something that can compile, they would not be able to change your
 *          code to a state that we can't detect the act of plagiarism. For the
 *          first commit of plagiarism, regardless you shared your code or
 *          copied code from others, you will receive 0 with an addition of 5
 *          mark penalty. If you commit plagiarism twice, your case will be
 *          presented in the exam board and you will receive a F directly.
 *
 *          If you cannot work out the logic of the assignment, simply contact
 *          us on Piazza. The teaching team is more the eager to provide
 *          you help. We can extend your submission due if it is really
 *          necessary. Just please, don't give up.
